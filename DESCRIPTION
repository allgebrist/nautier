Title: Graph Canonical Labeling and Automorphism Group Computation

Description: nauty and Traces are programs for computing automorphism
    groups of graphs. They can also produce a canonical label. There is a
    small suite of programs called gtools included in the package. For
    example, geng can generate non-isomorphic graphs very quickly. There
    are also generators for bipartite graphs, digraphs, and multigraphs,
    and programs for manipulating files of graphs in a compact format.
